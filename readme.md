# Belgium Traffic Sign Classification 

## About

<p>Apply different classification techniques using machine learning and deep learning models on belgium traffic sign for classification dataset</p>


***

## Dataset:

Belgium Traffic Sign for Classification **[Dataset](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~timofter/traffic_signs/)**

### Number of classes and their labels

Dataset contain 62 different classes labelled as [0:61]

### Dataset Images Numbers and size

Dataset contain 7095 images but with different size

### Training, Validation and Testing

Dataset already split as 4575 images for training data and 2520 images for testing data 


***

## Non-Deep Models

### Extracted Features 

In preprocessing step we resize all image to 64x64 px and use grayscale raw pixel values as features so there are 4096 features to use in the model

***

### Logistic Regression (LR)

Hyper-parameters

<ul>
  <li>the cost function is equal to the sum of - Y times the national log of prediction</li>
  <li>optimizer is GradientDescentOptimizer with learning rate equal to 0.01</li>
  <li>number of epochs equal to 1000 and batch size equal to 900</li>
  <li>number of batches depending on training data equal to 5 </li>
</ul>

#### LR Results

the LR model labeled 82.58% of the testing images correctly
